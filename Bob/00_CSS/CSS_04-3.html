		Things look clear in black and white 
		The living color tends to dye our sight 
		Like dynomite 
		
		Just imagine my surprise 
		When I looked into your eyes and saw 
		Your disguise 
		
		If we dare expose our hearts 
		Just to feel the purest parts 
		That's when strange sensations start to grow 
		
		We are not alone 
		Find out when your cover's blown 
		There'll be somebody there to break your fall 
		We are not alone
